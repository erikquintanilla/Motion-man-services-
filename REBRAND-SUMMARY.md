‚úÖ **Immediate**: Changes live on website right away
‚úÖ **Reversible**: Easy to change back if needed
‚úÖ **No Downtime**: Website continues working perfectly

## Future: Complete Rebrand (Option B)

When you have more time, we can do a full rebrand including:
- [ ] Rename GitHub repository to `oakland-cleanups`
- [ ] Update local folder path
- [ ] Update git remote URL
- [ ] Update localStorage keys
- [ ] Update any QR codes or printed materials
- [ ] Redirect old URLs if needed

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [x] Website title shows "Oakland Cleanups"
- [x] Logo/header shows "Oakland Cleanups"
- [x] Booking emails have correct subject line
- [x] Calendar downloads have correct filename
- [x] Footer copyright updated
- [x] All contact info correct

## Notes

- All existing bookings in localStorage are preserved
- Auto-refresh system will ensure users see new branding
- No customer-facing references to "Motion Man" remain
- Repository/folder names can be updated later without affecting functionality
